= Zero Downtime Deployment Database Issues

{repo_url}

This article will explain in more depth how to tackle issues related to database compatibility with Spring Boot and
database versioning tooling. We will present what can happen with your production applications if you try to perform
such a deployment unprepared. We will also walk through the lifecycle of an application in order to perform zero
downtime deployment and at the end of day apply a backwards incompatible database change in a backwards compatible way.

== Introduction

=== Zero downtime deployment

What is this mythical *zero downtime deployment*? You can say that your application is deployed that way if you can
successfully introduce a new version of your application to production without making the user see that the application
went down in the meantime. From the user's and the company's point of view it's the best possible scenario of deployment
since new features can be introduced and bugs can be eliminated without any outage.

How can you achieve that? There are number of ways but one of them is just to:

- deploy version 1 of your service
- migrate your database to a new version
- deploy version 2 of your service in parallel to the version 1
- once you see that version 2 works like a charm just bring down version 1
- you're done!

Easy, isn't it? Unfortunately it's not that easy and we'll focus on that later on. Right now let's check another
common deployment process which is the blue green deployment.

Have you ever heard of http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html[blue green deployment]? With Cloud Foundry it's
 extremely easy to do. Just check out https://spring.io/blog/2014/04/04/project-sagan-zero-downtime-deployments[this article] where
 we describe it in more depth. To quickly recap, doing blue green deployment is as simple as:

[quote]
____
- maintain two copies of your production environment (“blue” and “green”);
- route all traffic to the the blue environment by mapping production URLs to it;
- deploy and test any changes to the application in the green environment;
- “flip the switch” by mapping URLs onto green and unmapping them from blue.
____

Blue green deployment is an approach that gives you ease of introducing new features without the stress that
something will completely blow up on production. That's due to the fact that even if that would be the case,
you can easily rollback your router to point to a previous environment just by "flipping the switch".

After reading all of the above you could ask yourself a question: _What does zero downtime deployment have to do with Blue green deployment?_

Well, they have quite a lot in common since maintaining two copies of the same environment leads to doubling the effort
required to support it. That's why some teams, as http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html[Martin Fowler states it],
tend to perform a variation of that approach:

[quote]
____
Another variation would be to use the same database, making the blue-green switches for web and domain layers.

Databases can often be a challenge with this technique, particularly when you need to change the schema to support a new version of the software.
____

And here we arrive to the main problem that we will touch in this article. *The database*. Let's have another glimpse on this phrase:

> migrate your database to a new version

Now you should ask yourself a question - what if the database change is backwards incompatible? Won't my version 1 of the application
 just blow up? Actually it will...

So even though the benefits of zero downtime / blue green deployment are gigantic, companies tend to follow such a safer process
 of deploying their apps:

- prepare a package with the new version of the application
- shut down the running application
- run the database migration scripts
- deploy and run the new version of the application

In this article we'll describe in more depth how you can work with your database and your code so that you can profit from the
benefits of the zero downtime deployment.

=== Database issues

If you have a stateless application that doesn't store any data in the database then you can start doing zero downtime deployment
right now. Unfortunately most software has to store the data somewhere. That's why you have to think twice before doing any sort
of schema changes. Before we go into the details of how to change the schema in such a way that zero downtime deployment is possible
let's focus on schema versioning first.

==== Schema versioning

In this article we will use http://flywaydb.org[Flyway] as a schema versioning tool. Naturally we're also writing a Spring Boot application
that has native support for Flyway and will execute the schema migration upon application context setup. When using Flyway
 you can store the migration scripts inside your projects folder (by default under `classpath:db/migration`). Here you can see an example
 of such migration files

[source,bash]
------
└── db
 └── migration
     ├── V1__init.sql
     ├── V2__Add_surname.sql
     ├── V3__Final_migration.sql
     └── V4__Remove_lastname.sql
------

In this example we can see 4 migration scripts that, if not executed previously, will be executed one after another when the application
starts. Let's take a look at one of the files (`V1__init.sql`) as an example.

[source,sql]
-----
Unresolved directive in README.adoc - include::../../../../boot-flyway-v4/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql[]
-----

It's pretty self-explanatory: you can use SQL in order to define how your database should be changed. For more information about Spring Boot
and Flyway http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.3.5.RELEASE/reference/html/howto-database-initialization.html#howto-execute-flyway-database-migrations-on-startup[check the Spring Boot Docs].

Using a schema versioning tool with Spring Boot, you receive 2 great benefits.

- you decouple database changes from the code changes
- database migration happens together with your application deployment - your deployment process gets simplified

== Solving the database issue

In the following section of the article we will focus on presenting two approaches to database changes.

- backwards incompatible
- backwards compatible

The first one will be shown as a warning to not try to do zero downtime deployment without some preparations.
The second one will present a suggested solution of how one can perform zero downtime deployment and maintain
backwards compatibility at the same time.

Our project that we will work on will be a simple Spring Boot Flyway application in which we have a `Person`
that has a `first_name` and a `last_name` in the database. We want to rename the `last_name` column into `surname`.

=== Assumptions

Before we go into details we need to define a couple of assumptions towards our applications. The key result that we
would like to obtain is to have a fairly simple process.

TIP: Business PRO-TIP. Simplifying processes can save you a lot of money on support (the more people work in your company the more money you can save)!

*We don't want to do database rollbacks*

Not doing them simplifies the deployment process (some database rollbacks are close to impossible like rolling back a delete).
We prefer to rollback only the applications. That way even if you have different databases (e.g. SQL and NoSQL) then your
deployment pipeline will look the same.

*We want to ALWAYS be able to rollback the application one version back (not more)*

We want to rollback only as a necessity. If there is a bug in the current version that can't be solved easily we want to be
 able to bring back the last working version. We assume that this last working version is the previous one. Maintaining code and database
 compatibility for more than a single deployment would be extremely difficult and costly.

TIP: For readability purposes we will be versioning the applications in this article with major increments.

=== Renaming a column in backwards-compatible way

This is the most frequent situation that we can encounter. We need to perform backwards incompatible changes. We have already
proven that in order to do zero downtime deployment we must not simply apply the database migration without extra work. In this
section of the article we will go through 3 deployments of the application together with the database migrations in order to achieve
the desired effect and at the same time be backwards compatbile.

TIP: As a reminder - Let's assume that we have the DB in version `v1`. It contains the columns `first_name` and `last_name`.
We want to change the `last_name` into `surname`. We also have the app in version `1.0.0` which doesn't use the `surname` column just yet.

=== Recap

We have successfully applied the backwards incompatible change of renaming the column by doing a couple of
 backwards compatible deploys. Here you can find the summary of the performed actions:

. deploy version `1.0.0` of the application with `v1` of db schema (column name = `last_name`)
. deploy version `2.0.0` of the application that saves data to `last_name` and `surname` columns.
The app reads from `last_name` column. Db is in version `v2` containing both `last_name` and `surname` columns. The `surname` column is
a copy of the `last_name` column. (NOTE: this column must not have the not null constraint)
. deploy version `3.0.0` of the application that saves data only to `surname` and reads from `surname`. As for the db the final
migration of `last_name` to `surname` takes place. Also the *NOT NULL* constraint is dropped from `last_name`. Db is now in version `v3`
. deploy version `4.0.0` of the application - there are no changes in the code. Deploy db in `v4` that first
preforms a final migration of `last_name` to `surname` and removes the `last_name` column. Here you can add any missing constraints

By following this approach you can always rollback one version back without breaking the database / application compatibility.

== Code

All the code used in this article is available at {repo_url}[Github]. Below you can find some additional description.

=== Projects

Once you clone the repo you'll see the following folder structure.

[source,bash]
-------
├── boot-flyway-v1              - 1.0.0 version of the app with v1 of the schema
├── boot-flyway-v2              - 2.0.0 version of the app with v2 of the schema (backwards-compatible - app can be rolled back)
├── boot-flyway-v2-bad          - 2.0.0.BAD version of the app with v2bad of the schema (backwards-incompatible - app cannot be rolled back)
├── boot-flyway-v3              - 3.0.0 version of the app with v3 of the schema (app can be rolled back)
└── boot-flyway-v4              - 4.0.0 version of the app with v4 of the schema (app can be rolled back)
-------

=== Scripts

You can run the scripts to execute the scenario that show the backwards compatible and incompatible changes applied to the db.

To check the *backwards compatible* case just run:

[source,bash]
-------
./scripts/scenario_backwards_compatible.sh
-------

To check the *backwards incompatible* case just run:

[source,bash]
-------
./scripts/scenario_backwards_incompatible.sh
-------

=== Spring Boot Sample Flyway

All samples are clones of the `Spring Boot Sample Flyway` project.

You can look at `http://localhost:8080/flyway` to review the list of scripts.

The sample also enables the H2 console (at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`)
so that you can review the state of the database (the default jdbc url is
`jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`).
